## Overview

BhargavaSwara bridges the rich tradition of Indian Classical Music with modern audio processing techniques. The toolkit provides a robust platform for both music analysis and synthesis. With a Flutter-based interface, users can easily interact with sophisticated features including:

- **Music Analysis:** Advanced tools for raga recognition, tala recognition, tempo detection, ornamentation detection & classification, and real-time music analysis.
- **Spectrogram Generation:** Visualizations using MFCC, Mel spectrograms, and various signal processing graphs.
- **Music Synthesis:** Capabilities for instrument imitation, tanpura drone sound generation, and tala generation.

---

## Features

### Music Analysis Tools
- **Raga Recognition:** Identify and analyze the raga being performed.
- **Tala Recognition:** Detect and interpret rhythmic patterns (talas) within the music.
- **Tempo Detection:** Automatically determine the tempo of musical pieces.
- **Ornamentation Detection & Classification:** Analyze subtle musical embellishments unique to Indian Classical styles.
- **Hindustani/Carnatic Identifier:** Distinguish between Hindustani and Carnatic music styles.
- **Real-Time Music Analysis:** Process live or recorded audio for immediate insights.
- **Spectrogram Visualizations:** Generate MFCC, Mel spectrograms, and various signal processing graphs to visualize audio features.

### Music Synthesis Tools
- **Instrument Imitation:** Synthesize sounds that mimic traditional musical instruments.
- **Tanpura Drone Generation:** Produce continuous tanpura drone sounds to support musical practice.
- **Tala Generation:** Create rhythmic cycles and patterns that emulate traditional talas.

## Usage

BhargavaSwara is engineered to offer a seamless experience for both analysis and synthesis of music:

- **Analyzing Music:**
  - Process audio files or live input to detect ragas, talas, tempo, and ornamentations.
  - Generate detailed spectrograms (MFCC, Mel spectrograms) and signal graphs for in-depth analysis.
  - Utilize the Hindustani/Carnatic identifier to classify music styles.

- **Synthesizing Music:**
  - Create realistic instrument sounds through advanced synthesis algorithms.
  - Generate a tanpura drone to provide a harmonic base.
  - Experiment with tala generation to create rhythmic cycles.
